This is a thing
after 7 is PM if the am/pm is missing

tags.txt has "valid" tags and the validation function will display invalid tags

stuff up here is generic to the tracker

#support #my-test #meeting

tags can be anywhere, but part of the header is ideal.

1:13 am - 1:30 am

did some stuff, blaa blaa blaa

Stuff in here should match the time segment above

> 1:16 am

Times with a carrot are within a segment, and part of a chronology. This is for keeping
track of events in time. An example is when you joined the meeting.

1:50 am

Segments without a ending are assumed to have ended in the same minute. In order to declare something not yet
ended, use a trailing dash.

1:13 am - 1:30 am

did some other stuff.

2:00 - 2:21

Found issue with thing, working on it.
